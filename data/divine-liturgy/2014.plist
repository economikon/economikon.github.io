Blessed are You, Christ our God, Glory of the Father and Image of his Essence. You were incarnate of the all-holy Virgin in an ineffable way. You were presented to God the Father and carried in the arms of Simeon the Just. You were revealed as radiant Light to every human being coming into this world. You established the Catholic and Apostolic Church as a Lighthouse propagating the teachings of your Gospel. 
We ask You in your Mercies to extend your all-holy and all-powerful Hand and bless () these candles by the descent of your Holy Spirit. Infuse them with your abundant Grace so that they become a spiritual light for all their bearers. May the faithful lighting them live their whole day in sincere love and their whole night quietly enjoying your grace. May they get up early and come to your Encounter, Beloved Groom, with enlightened and joyful faces. May they welcome You with brightly shining lamps like the Wise Virgins. May they finally win their eternal reward in the heavenly Bridal Chambers, glorifying your  magnificent name, and  your Eternal Father and your All-holy, Good and Life-giving Spirit, now and always and forever and ever.

• The wind sweeps over him and he is gone; his place knows him no more.
• But the mercy of the Lord is from all eternity and to all eternity for those who fear Him.
• And His justice is upon the children of children of those who keep His covenant and remember His laws to obey them.

      <string>O Creator of the Universe, You fashioned Adam from the dust of the earth. You infused him with a breath of life. You gave him dominion over the earth.

We therefore implore You, at the threshold of Holy and Great Lent, to make us worthy of a sincere repentance, so that we may avoid even the shadow of evil and abstain from carnal pleasure in order to gain You, Divine River of Paradise that quenches the thirst of our souls. Thus, having lived according to your commandments, we may share the glory of the Resurrection of Christ, our God and Savior.

(Psalms 102)
Refrain: Bless the Lord, O my soul! Blessed are You, O Lord!
• Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is in me bless His holy name.
• Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget none of His blessings.
• Who pardons all your sins and heals all your diseases.
• Who ransoms your life from corruption and crowns you with love and mercy.
• Who fills your life with what is good and your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.

Refrain: Bless the Lord, O my soul! Blessed are You, O Lord!
• The Lord is compassionate and merciful, long‐suffering and rich in mercy. His contention is not forever nor shall His anger always last.
• He deals not with us as our sins demand, nor does He repay our evil deeds.
• For as high as the heavens stand over the earth, so high has the Lord extended His love for those who fear Him.
• As far as the East stands away from the West, so far has He put our sins from us.
• As kind as a father is towards his children, so kind is the Lord for those who fear Him.
• For He Himself knows well how we were formed, Remember, we are only dust.
• A man! His days resemble grass: as a flower of the field, so shall he bloom.
• The wind sweeps over him and he is gone; his place knows him no more.
• But the mercy of the Lord is from all eternity and to all eternity for those who fear Him.
• And His justice is upon the children of children of those who keep His covenant and remember His laws to obey them.
OR
Refrain: Bless the Lord, O my soul! Blessed are You, O Lord!
• The Lord has established His throne in Heaven: over all things His kingship is supreme.
• Bless the Lord, all you His angels, you strong and mighty ones who obey His word on hearing the sound of His decrees.
• Bless the Lord, all you His powers, His attendants who obey His will.
• Bless the Lord, all you His works in every place of His dominion.
• Bless the Lord, O my soul.
And
• Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and always and forever and ever. Amen.

People: Lord, have mercy.
Priest: Lord our God, You are seated upon the throne of the Cherubim, and by your sublime power You have sent your Only-begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, to save the world by his Crucifixion, Burial and Resurrection. When He entered Jerusalem to suffer the Crucifixion of his own free will, the people sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death took branches of olive and palm trees as the symbols of victory and proclaimed beforehand his Resurrection.
Therefore, O Lord, as we imitate these same people, preserve and keep us while we carry in our own hands palms and branches of trees on this vigil of the feast. Like the crowds and children who shouted to You “ Hosanna!”, make us worthy through our praises, chants and spiritual hymns of the glorious Resurrection on the third day of the same Jesus Christ our Lord, with Whom You are blessed together with your All-holy, Good and Life-giving Spirit, now and always and forever and ever.

• For as high as the heavens stand over the earth, so high has the Lord extended His love for those who fear Him.
• As far as the East stands away from the West, so far has He put our sins from us.
• As kind as a father is towards his children, so kind is the Lord for those who fear Him.
• For He Himself knows well how we were formed, Remember, we are only dust.
• A man! His days resemble grass: as a flower of the field, so shall he bloom.
• The wind sweeps over him and he is gone; his place knows him no more.
• But the mercy of the Lord is from all eternity and to all eternity for those who fear Him.
• And His justice is upon the children of children of those who keep His covenant and remember His laws to obey them.
OR
Refrain: Bless the Lord, O my soul! Blessed are You, O Lord!
• The Lord has established His throne in Heaven: over all things His kingship is supreme.
• Bless the Lord, all you His angels, you strong and mighty ones who obey His word on hearing the sound of His decrees.
• Bless the Lord, all you His powers, His attendants who obey His will.
• Bless the Lord, all you His works in every place of His dominion.
• Bless the Lord, O my soul.
And
• Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and always and forever and ever. Amen.
