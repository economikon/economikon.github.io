      <string>O Creator of the Universe, You fashioned Adam from the dust of the earth. You infused him with a breath of life. You gave him dominion over the earth. By the enticement of the Serpent he rebelled against Your Commandments and fell. You therefore exiled him from Paradise. But your Only-begotten Son was incarnate, endured Passion and restored us to the Garden of Eden which we had lost. We therefore implore You, at the threshold of Holy and Great Lent, to make us worthy of a sincere repentance, so that we may avoid even the shadow of evil and abstain from carnal pleasure in order to gain You, Divine River of Paradise that quenches the thirst of our souls. Thus, having lived according to your commandments, we may share the glory of the Resurrection of Christ, our God and Savior.
For You are long-suffering, most compassionate and You call all people to salvation; and to You we render glory, honor and worship, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, now and always and forever and ever.</string>

      <string>O Christ our God, who took flesh from the all-pure Virgin for our salvation, You adorned her soul beforehand with the gifts of the Holy Spirit, preparing her as a receptacle and throne for your Divinity.
Through her, Adam and his descendants obtained renewal of life. And through her birth today, the whole creation rejoices with the dawn of salvation to come.
We ask You through her intercession, to renew our mind, enlighten our souls and grant us your joy and peace.
For You are the King of Peace and the Savior of our souls, O Christ God, and to You we render glory and to your Eternal Father and your All-holy, Good and Life-giving Spirit, now and always and forever and ever.</string>
