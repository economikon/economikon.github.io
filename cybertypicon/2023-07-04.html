ANTIPHONS PRAYER

    <div class='text'>
Lord God, teach us your righteousness, your commands and your statutes. Illumine the eyes of our minds. Keep every darkness away from our hearts. Bestow upon us the sun of justice. Protect our lives from every evil by the seal of your Holy Spirit, so that we may give a good defense before the judgment seat of your Christ, for yours is the kingdom, the power and the glory, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, now and always and forever and ever. Amen.

EPISTLE: FIRST CORINTHIANS 1:1-9 * (6TH WEEK AFTER PENTECOST)

    <div class='text'>
 Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes, To the church of God that is in Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, together with all those who in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. I give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that has been given you in Christ Jesus, for in every way you have been enriched in him, in speech and knowledge of every kind— just as the testimony of Christ has been strengthened among you— so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ. He will also strengthen you to the end, so that you may be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is faithful; by him you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

GOSPEL: MATTHEW 13:24-30 * (6TH WEEK AFTER PENTECOST) 
    </div></div>

    <div class='text'>
Jesus told this parable: ‘The kingdom of heaven may be compared to someone who sowed good seed in his field; but while everybody was asleep, an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and then went away. So when the plants came up and bore grain, then the weeds appeared as well. And the slaves of the householder came and said to him, “Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? Where, then, did these weeds come from?” He answered, “An enemy has done this.” The slaves said to him, “Then do you want us to go and gather them?” But he replied, “No; for in gathering the weeds you would uproot the wheat along with them. Let both of them grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, Collect the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.”’
